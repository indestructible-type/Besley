Besley* is an original font created by indestructible type*. It is inspired by 
the designs of Robert Besley. This is version 2.011.

Besley* is designed and maintained by [Owen Earl](https://plus.google.com/103790404905174393616), who is the creator of the font foundry [indestructible type*](http://indestructible-type.github.io).

About
-----
The design process of Besley* started with looking at what works with 
Clarendon and maintaining those assets, while expanding design and 
functionality. In order to maintain a sturdy and heavy weighting, while adding 
text-size readability, wide capitals are used alongside appropriately widthed 
lowercase letters. To make Besley* render well on screens, a larger x-height 
was chosen. The medium weight of Besley* is bolder than typical fonts of the 
digital era, to give that cowboy era weight. Italics were built into the 
design process, so they feel like part of the family, instead of an 
after-thought.

Building
--------
Build scripts can be found inside the "sources" folder. To build, download and install the required software listed in the "requirements.txt" file and run the build script that corresponds to your desired output (so if you want woff2 files run "build-woff2.sh")

Contributing
---------------
Besley* is built and maintained using the open-source program [FontForge](https://fontforge.org), and by default will build the finished fonts using the FontForge files as sources. FontForge is free and cross platform, so it is possible for anyone looking to contribute to this project to use it to make modifications to the source files.

If you'd rather work with UFO files, simply run the "build-ufo.sh" shell script, and UFO files will be generated using the FontForge files as sources. If a "ufo" folder is detected in the "sources" folder, the other build scripts will automatically switch to using the UFO files as sources instead of the FontForge files. All the scripts should work without having FontForge installed, so you should be able to contribute using your software of choice without downloading unwanted software.
