`sfd2ufo` — An SFD to UFO converter
===================================

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sfdLib.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/sfdLib)

A simple utility to convert FontForge’s SFD fonts to UFO fonts. The main
objective is to create UFO files that are usable in a larger UFO based
workflow, and for that existing UFO libraries are used to generate the UFO
fonts.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U sfdLib # add --user for local install
```

Or:

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/MFEK/sfdLib.py.git
cd ./sfdLib.py/
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
